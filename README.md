# Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„ðŸ¦€

<https://adventofcode.com/2023>

## Setup

- Clone this repo (into ~/projects/ for example)
- Run `rustup` if you don't have Rust installed <https://rustup.rs/>
- Run `cargo run --release` in the terminal

## Hardware

Macbook M1 2020 (aarch64), 16GB RAM

## Spoilers

If you compile this and run it, the answers to the problems will be spoiled
for you! Run at your own risk.

## Notes

- Code is not optimized for readability or speed of execution
- Execution times are an estimate, they're not run 1000x for more accurate averages.
- `unwrap()/expect()` everywhere! I'm not shooting for perfect, correct Rust :)
